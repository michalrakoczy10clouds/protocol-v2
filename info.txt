General thoughts
On Drift: All trades are done like: <input asset> | PERP token (Perpetual Protocol token) https://www.coinbase.com/pl/price/perpetual-protocol
For Deriverse do we want to use also PERP? This is how it looks on figma. But user can deposit USDC, so should USDC be swapped to PERP?

Deposit
Drift: user deposits SOL which value is at least 10 USD.
Deriverse: user deposits at least 50 USDC.
to discover: is deposit swapped to PERP in Drift.
